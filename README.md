# YASP: To Do
- A config directory (in `sourcemod/configs`)
  - shop.cfg :: Purpose: Create items.
  - nametag.cfg :: Purpose: To set item's nametag properties.
- Support for nametags (only nametags for now)
- An inventory system; storing player's inventory in-game could be done with the assignment of an int to each item, avoiding db lookups.
